## 📖 Project Introduction
**Argo-suoha** is a fully automated one-click deployment script based on Cloudflare Tunnel (Argo) technology.

It is designed to solve the problem where machines without public IP, strict firewalls, or NAT environments (such as HAX, IPv6-only VPS) cannot expose services to the public. By establishing an outbound tunnel, it enables secure public access to local services without any port mapping.

This project is refactored & optimized by **tt** , integrating the latest Xray core, fixing logic flaws in the original version, and providing more stable connections and improved domain camouflage.

## ✨ Core Features

* **⚡️Zero-barrier deployment**：No public IP, no complex firewall configuration — one command to “suoha”.
* **🛡️Advanced camouflage**：Automatically configures domain-based routing (SNI/Host separation) to resist active probing.
* **🛠Multi-protocol support**：Freely choose **VMess** 或 **VLESS** according to your client needs.
* **🌍Cross-architecture compatibility**：Fully supports `x86_64` (AMD64), `arm64` (Mac M1/VPS), `armv7` ,and more.
* **🚀Smart optimization**：Built-in Argo tunnel optimization to automatically find the best Cloudflare access point.
* 
## 📌 Feature Highlights
* **🚀Suoha Mode (Temporary Tunnel)**
No domain required
The temporary tunnel becomes invalid after reboot; script must be re-run

* **🚀Service Mode (Persistent Tunnel)**
Requires a Cloudflare-managed domain bound to Argo Tunnel
Service remains active after reboot

Both modes support:
Automatic CF Argo node optimization
VMess and VLESS
No public IP, no port forwarding, fully stealth
